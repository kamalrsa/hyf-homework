My second favorite food is Indian food for two reason. 
First of all, I like Rice because they are soft and they have a delicious rice and achar on it.
In the daal, you can put a spicy sauce to add flavor. Next, I like chow fun because it is very oily.
curry is spicy to eat because you can stack it up and stab it with your spoons. 
Therefore chinese food is my favorite food.
