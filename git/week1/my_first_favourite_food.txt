My favorite food is chinese food for two reason. 
First of all, I like noodles because they are soft and they have a delicious soup on it.
In the noodle, you can put a spicy sauce to add flavor. Next, I like chow fun because it is very oily.
Chow fun is fun to eat because you can stack it up and stab it with your chopstick. 
Therefore chinese food is my favorite food.
